          Do you remember when 'radical' used to mean something truly
          transformative? Around 30 AD, a man named Jesus claimed to be the Son
          of God. His radical teachings challenged the norms, advocating love
          even for one's enemies. His message remains as powerful today as it
          was 2,000 years ago.
